# 🐍 Python Simple Test Repository

This repository hosts a minimal Python project designed specifically for testing and integration purposes.

## 🎯 Goal

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a functional sandbox to validate integrations between various development and quality assurance tools.

## ✨ Key Integrations & Testing Focus

This project is used to specifically test and demonstrate the following connections:

* **Jira Integration:** Validating that commits, branches, and pull requests correctly link development work to specific Jira issues (e.g., SOLI-2).
* **Xray Test Management:** Validating the execution of automated tests and the seamless reporting of test results back into Xray within Jira.
* **CI/CD Pipeline Triggers:** Testing that changes pushed to the `main` branch correctly initiate automated build and test workflows in continuous integration systems.

## 📂 Repository Contents

The repository currently contains:

* `test_math.py`: A simple Python file using the `unittest` framework with guaranteed passing tests.
* *(Any other files, e.g., a license or CI configuration, would be listed here.)*
